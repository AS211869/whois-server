# whois-server

This is a simple file-based WHOIS server.

After running for the first time, a data directory will be created containing subdirectories for the supported WHOIS data types: ASN, Domain, IPv4, IPv6. Create your WHOIS data files in the appropriate directories. Queries will be matched against the lowercased file name. For IP files, the file name is the CIDR, replacing `:` with `-` and `/` with `_`.

This whois server also supports referrals. To add a referral, add a `_REFER` field in the relevant WHOIS data file, with the data set to the WHOIS server the request should be referred to. Example: `_REFER: whois://whois.ripe.net`. Your WHOIS client must support ARIN style referrals for this to work.

Lines starting with an underscore are ignored.
